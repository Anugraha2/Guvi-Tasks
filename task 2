Difference Between Document and Window Object
The document and window objects are two fundamental components of the JavaScript language. They are often used in web development to manipulate the content and behavior of web pages.
Window Object: The window object represents the browser window or tab in which a web page is loaded. It is the global object in a browser environment, all global variables and functions are properties of the window object. The window object has many useful properties and methods, such as the location object, which provides information about the current URL, and the setTimeout function, which allows you to execute code after a specified delay.
Document: The document object, on the other hand, represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window. It is a property of the window object and can be accessed using either window.document or simply document. The document object provides access to the elements on a web page, allowing you to manipulate their content and behavior. For example, you can use the document.getElementById method to select an element by its ID, or the document.createElement method to create a new element.
